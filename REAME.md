##  Project Name: RECIPES AND COCKTAILS

## Project Description

  For this project We are going to make a website for getting recipes of what you want to eat based off the API we added to our code. The website will also have an option for choosing a cocktail you want to drink that night based off another API. When the user goes to our website they are greeted with a login page. once the user logs in they will be greeted with two search bars one for meals one for cocktails.the website will output the best matches of meals and cocktails. 

## user Story

As a CONSUMER I want to browse different recipes so I can add them to my cookbook.
As a USER when I log on to the website I want to be greeted with a log on page.
when I log on I want to be able to search for recipes of food and cocktails.
As a USER I can conduct another search after my first one.
